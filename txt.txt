There are five key components that directly influence your credit score:

Payment History – Making on-time payments consistently builds strong credit.

Amounts Owed – Keeping your credit balances low boosts your score.

Length of Credit History – A longer history shows responsibility and reliability.

New Credit – Limiting unnecessary new accounts prevents dips in your score.

Credit Mix – Managing different types of credit demonstrates financial capability.

Improving your credit score takes time, patience, and the right strategy — and that’s exactly where we come in.
