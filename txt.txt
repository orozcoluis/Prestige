        Yes ‚Äî credit repair is 100% legal under federal law. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) give you the right to dispute inaccurate, outdated, or unverifiable information on your credit reports. At Prestige Financial Consulting, we work within these legal protections to help you exercise your rights and improve your credit profile.
        I had repossessions and even a child support delinquency on my credit report. I thought those would stay forever, but Prestige was able to dispute and remove them. My credit has never looked better.
